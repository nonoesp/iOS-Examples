# Sample Pinch Gesture

An example on how to self-implement a UIPinchGestureRecognizer on a ViewController and respond to it.

Other recognizers, such as UITapGestureRecognizer or UISwipeGestureRecognizer, could be implemented the same way.

It is useful to check the class reference of each of these gesture recognizers to see what methods are made available on the parameter passed on the target method.

* [UIPinchGestureRecognizer](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIPinchGestureRecognizer_Class/), for instance, provides two properties: scale and velocity.
